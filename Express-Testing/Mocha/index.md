Mocha

Mocha excels at testing asynchronous code:
.then()
.catch()
async await
CRUD apps (or apps that require In/Out communication (talking to another service)).

Mocha is installed with npm but it is installed globally. This means we don't need to install it for each project, but it doesn't install for each project you build.

Mocha is ran from the Command Line, so it must be installed to our main computer so we can use it.

'npm i mocha -g'
