Express is a minimalist framework to handle web functionality in a node.js app. 

Limited functionality but very compatible with custom and extra middleware.

Middleware - Helps communication between two layers, two apps.

Middleware for client <-> server between two different parts of our backend.

Express gives us a HTTP request API we can customise, including GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

INSTALL EXPRESS

1) NPM init in the Express file.
