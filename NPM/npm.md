NPM - Node Packet Manager

Packages our projects and code into executable directories and allows us to import packages published to the NPM Repo.

Packages are codebases that have been supplied with any code needed to run functions and any external dependencies.

When in appropriate EMPTY(ish) directory, npm init.

Entry point - main 

Exercise - Create a NPM project using npm init

NPM /Node Scripts we can use:
you can access by typing npm run <script name>

Some named scripts can run without specifying run:

test

In order to install node modules for dependencies use npm install

To remove packages use 'npm remove <package name>'
